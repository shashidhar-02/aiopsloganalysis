# AIOps Log Analysis

AIOps Log Analysis is an intelligent log analytics platform designed to automate log parsing, anomaly detection, and actionable insights for IT operations. Harnessing the power of machine learning and AI, it helps organizations efficiently manage, monitor, and troubleshoot large-scale system logs.

## Features

- **Automated Log Ingestion**: Seamlessly collect and parse logs from multiple sources.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns and critical incidents using ML algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for log trends, error rates, and system health.
- **Alerting System**: Real-time alerts for detected anomalies and important events.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Easily adapt analysis workflows to your infrastructure needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
